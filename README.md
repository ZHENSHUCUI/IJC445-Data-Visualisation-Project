# IJC445-Data-Visualisation-Project
Coursework for IJC445 – Data Visualisation
This project investigates whether audio features differ systematically between popular and non-popular songs using the Musicoset dataset.
A composite visualisation combines correlation analysis, group comparisons, temporal trends, and distributional analysis of key Spotify audio features.
The results suggest that popular songs tend to be slightly more danceable and positive, and less acoustic, although effect sizes are small and distributions largely overlap.
